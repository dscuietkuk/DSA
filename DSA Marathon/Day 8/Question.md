<h1 align="center">Problem Statement</h1>

Given a `doubly linked list`, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by `P` nodes. Here `P` is a given positive integer and is smaller than the count of `nodes(N)` in a linked list.

### Input :

The first line of input contains an integer `T` denoting the no of `test cases`. For each test case, the first line of input contains two integers `N` and `P` denoting the number of nodes in Linked List and the number of nodes to be rotated respectively.


### Output :

For each test case, output the final linked list after the P rotations in it.

### Constraints :

<ul>
  <li>1 <= T <= 100</li>
  <li>2 <= N <= 100</li>
  <li>1 <= P <= N</li>
</ul>

### Example Input :

```
1
6 2
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

### Example Output :

```
3 4 5 6 1 2
```
