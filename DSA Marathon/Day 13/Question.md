<h1 align="center">Problem Statement</h1>

Given `N` integers, the task is to insert those elements in the queue. Also, given `M` integers, task is to find the `frequency` of each number in the Queue.

`Note : Solve this without using Built-in functions.`

### Input :
The first line contains a single integer `N`. The next line contains `N space seprated integers` denoting the elements of queue.Third line contains a single integer `M`, the next line contains `M space seprated integers` (You've to find frequency of each integer in Queue). 

### Output :
Print frequency of M space seprated integers if present in Queue,else print `-1` if the element is not present in Queue. 

### Constraints :
<ul>
  <li>1 <= N <= 10^3</li>
  <li>1 <= M <= 10^3</li>
  <li>1 <= Elements of Queue <= 10^6</li>
</ul>

### Example Input :
```
8
1 2 3 4 5 2 3 1
5
1 3 2 9 10
```

### Example Output :

```
2
2
2
-1
-1
```
